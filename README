The source code is made of two files, broken down below:

testsite.py posts a simple web page to mimic an active API. 
It supplies 7 test cases in JSON format, found at '/api/v1/resources/applicants/all'
Run this first to post the test website, and leave it running while you run sqlator.py

sqlator.py goes to the test site and pulls the JSON information. 
The supplied URL can be replaced with a URL and queries from a real API. In this case, you do not need to run testsite.py
It supplies a list of available position, grabs the JSON info, 
runs some error checks, then organizes the JSON data into a sql table with the specified columns.

Columns, in order, are: "First, Last, Position, Program, School, Time, id"
All of these keys must be included in the JSON for the applicant to be included in the SQL table

Valid applicants are saved to a sqlite database.
Repeat entries, invalid entries, and entries for unavailable positions are printed and skipped.
